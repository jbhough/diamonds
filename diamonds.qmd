## Introduction

This is an example of a Quarto document using R. Quarto allows you to weave together narrative text and executable code to create professional-looking reports.

## Running R Code

You can embed R code directly into your document using code chunks. The output of the code will be included in the rendered document.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Diamond Price vs. Carat by Cut",
    x = "Carat (Weight)",
    y = "Price (USD)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Updated at `r Sys.time()`.
